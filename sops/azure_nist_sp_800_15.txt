Azure / Active Directory–Focused Interview Questions
Based on NIST SP 800-145 (Cloud Computing Definition)
“In Azure, identity is the perimeter — and NIST SP 800-145 explains why that matters.”

Essential Characteristics (Azure + Identity Context)
1) How does Azure Active Directory enable “on-demand self-service” under NIST SP 800-145, and what new identity risks does this introduce?
2) Why is identity considered the primary control plane in Azure, and how does this align with NIST’s concept of broad network access?
3) How does Azure’s identity-first model change the trust boundary compared to traditional Active Directory environments?
4) Which Azure AD features most clearly support rapid elasticity, and why does this complicate access governance?
5) How does Azure AD logging and sign-in telemetry support NIST’s definition of measured service from a security standpoint?

Service Models (IaaS / PaaS / SaaS with Azure AD)
6) How does Azure Active Directory abstract identity differently across IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS services in Azure?
7) Why does NIST define service models by abstraction, and how does Azure AD demonstrate increasing abstraction across Azure services?
8) How does moving from IaaS-based authentication to Azure AD–integrated PaaS services change the shared responsibility model?

Resource Pooling & Multi-Tenancy (Azure AD Focus)
9) How does Azure Active Directory support multi-tenancy, and why is this a core security concern under NIST’s resource pooling characteristic?
10) What assumptions does Azure make about tenant isolation in Azure AD, and how should security teams validate those assumptions?
11) How do Azure AD tenants reflect NIST’s view of logical isolation rather than physical isolation?

Deployment Models (Azure Identity)
12) How does Azure AD support public cloud deployment under NIST SP 800-145, and what identity controls are required to manage that risk?
13) How does Azure AD enable hybrid cloud deployments, and why is identity the hardest part of hybrid cloud security?
14) In what scenarios could Azure AD support a “community cloud” model under NIST’s definition?

Virtualization vs Cloud (Identity-Centric View)
15) Why does NIST say virtualization alone is not cloud computing, and how does Azure AD illustrate this distinction?
16) Can you describe an Azure environment that uses virtual machines and Active Directory but does not fully meet NIST’s cloud definition?

Governance, Risk, and Identity Operations
17) How does NIST SP 800-145 influence how Azure AD roles and permissions should be designed?
18) Why is over-permissioning in Azure AD especially dangerous in a NIST-defined cloud environment?
19) How do Conditional Access and identity-based controls address risks introduced by broad network access?

Compliance, NIST, and FedRAMP (Azure Perspective)
20) Why is Azure Active Directory critical for meeting NIST and FedRAMP requirements in cloud environments?
21) How would you evaluate an Azure Government or Azure commercial tenant against NIST SP 800-145’s cloud definition?

Vendor Claims & Real-World Scenarios
22) If an organization claims Azure AD makes their environment “secure by default,” how would you challenge that claim using NIST SP 800-145?
23) How would you explain to leadership why identity misconfiguration in Azure AD is a cloud risk, not just an IT issue?

Senior / Architecture-Level Questions
24) How does NIST SP 800-145 help security architects reason about identity as the control plane in Azure?
25) Why does Azure AD become more critical—not less—as organizations move deeper into cloud-native and SaaS services?
