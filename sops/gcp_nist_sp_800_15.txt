GCP-Focused Interview Questions
Based on NIST SP 800-145 (Cloud Computing Definition)


Essential Characteristics (GCP Context)
1) How does Google Cloud demonstrate “on-demand self-service” under NIST SP 800-145, and what governance risks does this introduce in a GCP project?
2) Which GCP services best represent “broad network access,” and how does this characteristic expand the attack surface in GCP environments?
3) How does Google Cloud implement resource pooling, and what does multi-tenancy mean for services like Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, or BigQuery?
4) Which GCP features most clearly demonstrate “rapid elasticity,” and why does this make traditional security monitoring more difficult?
5) How does GCP’s billing, logging, and metrics infrastructure support the NIST concept of “measured service,” and why is this important for security accountability?

Service Models (IaaS / PaaS / SaaS in GCP)
6) Using GCP examples, explain how security responsibility shifts as you move from Compute Engine to services like Cloud Run, App Engine, or Google-managed SaaS offerings.
7) Why does NIST define cloud service models by abstraction level, and how is this abstraction clearly visible across GCP services?
8) How would you explain the security implications of moving from Compute Engine to Cloud Run using NIST’s service model framework?

Deployment Models (GCP)
9) How does Google Cloud meet the definition of a public cloud under NIST SP 800-145, and what would disqualify a GCP deployment from being considered cloud?
10) What architectures in GCP would qualify as hybrid cloud under NIST’s definition, and why?
11) How could GCP be used to support a “community cloud” model, even though Google Cloud itself is a public provider?

Virtualization vs Cloud (GCP)
12) Why does NIST state that virtualization alone is not cloud computing, and how does GCP go beyond virtualization to meet the cloud definition?
13) Can you describe a GCP environment that uses virtualization but fails to meet one or more NIST cloud characteristics?

Governance, Risk, and Security Operations (GCP)
14) How does NIST’s definition of cloud computing influence how IAM is designed in GCP at the organization, folder, and project levels?
15) Which GCP services help security teams manage the risks introduced by rapid elasticity and ephemeral resources?
16) How does GCP’s logging and monitoring architecture support accountability in a NIST-defined cloud environment?

Compliance, FedRAMP, and NIST Alignment
17) Why is NIST SP 800-145 foundational to FedRAMP, and how does Google Cloud align its platform offerings with that definition?
18) How would you use NIST SP 800-145 to evaluate whether a GCP-based government environment meets cloud computing requirements?

Vendor Claims & Real-World Scenarios
19) If an organization claims they are running a “private cloud” on GCP, how would you evaluate that claim using NIST SP 800-145?
20) How would you explain to leadership why simply hosting workloads in GCP does not automatically mean they are operating a true cloud environment?

Senior / Architecture-Level Questions
21) How does NIST SP 800-145 help security architects reason about service selection and risk tradeoffs in Google Cloud?
22) Why does NIST’s cloud definition remain relevant as GCP expands into managed, serverless, and AI-driven services?

Interview-Level Closing Line: “Google Cloud provides the platform — NIST SP 800-145 tells us whether we’re actually operating as cloud.”
