Homework: NIST SP 800-145 — Conceptual Understanding Questions

Answer each question in your own words. Do not quote the document directly. 
Assume you are explaining the concept to a technical manager, not a cloud engineer.

NIST defines cloud computing using five essential characteristics.
Why does NIST insist that all five must be present for a system to be considered “cloud computing,” rather than allowing partial definitions?

On-demand self-service is described as a key characteristic.
From a security and governance perspective, what risks does on-demand self-service introduce that do not exist in traditional IT environments?

Broad network access is emphasized in the definition.
Why is this characteristic especially important for cloud computing, and how does it change the security threat model compared to private data centers?

Resource pooling relies on a multi-tenant model.
What assumptions does NIST make about trust boundaries in multi-tenancy, and why is this a foundational concern for cloud security professionals?

Rapid elasticity allows resources to scale outward and inward quickly.
How does rapid elasticity complicate traditional approaches to capacity planning, security monitoring, and incident response?

Measured service is included as an essential characteristic.
Why does NIST treat metering and monitoring as a defining feature rather than a business feature, and how does this affect accountability?

NIST defines three cloud service models: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
Why does NIST avoid defining security responsibilities directly in this document, and instead focus on abstraction levels?

Cloud deployment models include public, private, community, and hybrid.
What problem is the “community cloud” attempting to solve that public or private clouds alone cannot?

NIST deliberately separates cloud computing from virtualization.
Why is virtualization necessary but not sufficient for cloud computing under NIST’s definition?

NIST SP 800-145 is intentionally short and non-prescriptive.
Why is this design choice important for long-term relevance, especially as cloud technologies evolve?
