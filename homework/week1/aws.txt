CCSP Focus

Domain 1 – Cloud Concepts, Architecture, Design
Core idea: Who is responsible for what, and why mistakes are yours

AWS LAB – Shared Responsibility Reality Check
Lab Title: AWS Shared Responsibility Boundary Validation

Success Criteria
  Student can correctly identify AWS-managed vs customer-managed controls
  Student produces a written responsibility table
  Student can verbally defend at least 3 boundaries

Technology to Use
  AWS Console
  IAM
  EC2
  S3

Architecture (Text Diagram)

[AWS Account]
   |
   +-- IAM
   |     +-- User
   |     +-- Role
   |
   +-- EC2 Instance
   |
   +-- S3 Bucket

Lab Actions
1) Create an EC2 instance
2) Create an S3 bucket
3) Identify:
  Who patches the hypervisor?
  Who secures the OS?
  Who encrypts the bucket?
  Who configures IAM?

Hints
  If AWS controls it, you cannot change it
  If you can misconfigure it, it’s probably your responsibility
  Think control, not service

Extensions
  Compare EC2 vs Lambda responsibility
  Identify what changes if S3 uses AWS-managed encryption vs CMK

Difficulty Multiplier (Hard Mode)
  Explain responsibility during a breach scenario
  “If data leaks, who is legally accountable and why?”
