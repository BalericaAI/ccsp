AWS-Focused Interview Questions
Based on NIST SP 800-145 (Cloud Computing Definition)

Essential Characteristics (AWS Context)
1) How does AWS demonstrate “on-demand self-service” as defined by NIST SP 800-145, and what security risks does this create in an AWS account?
2) Which AWS services best illustrate “broad network access,” and how does this characteristic affect the AWS threat model compared to on-prem systems?
3) How does AWS implement resource pooling, and what does multi-tenancy mean in practice for services like EC2, S3, or Lambda?
4) Which AWS features most clearly demonstrate “rapid elasticity,” and why does this characteristic complicate security monitoring in AWS?
5) How does AWS’s use of metering and logging support NIST’s definition of “measured service,” and why is this critical for security and audits?

Service Models (IaaS / PaaS / SaaS in AWS)
6) Using AWS examples, explain how security responsibility changes as you move from EC2 (IaaS) to services like RDS, Lambda, or managed SaaS offerings.
7) Why does NIST define service models by abstraction level, and how is this abstraction clearly visible in AWS services?
8) How would you explain the security implications of moving from EC2 to AWS Lambda using NIST’s cloud service model framework?

Deployment Models (AWS)
9) How does AWS implement a public cloud according to NIST SP 800-145, and what would disqualify an AWS environment from being considered “cloud” under NIST’s definition?
10) What AWS architectures would qualify as a hybrid cloud under NIST’s definition, and why?
11) How could AWS support a “community cloud” model, even though AWS itself is a public cloud provider?

Virtualization vs Cloud (AWS)
12) Why does NIST say virtualization alone is not cloud computing, and how does AWS go beyond virtualization to meet the cloud definition?
13) Can you give an example of an AWS environment that uses virtualization but might fail to meet one or more of NIST’s cloud characteristics?

Governance, Risk, and Security Operations (AWS)
14) How does NIST’s definition of cloud computing influence how security teams design IAM policies in AWS?
15) Which AWS services help address the risks introduced by rapid elasticity and ephemeral resources?
16) How does AWS logging and monitoring infrastructure support accountability in a NIST-defined cloud environment?

Compliance, FedRAMP, and NIST Alignment
17) Why is NIST SP 800-145 foundational to FedRAMP, and how does AWS align its cloud offerings with that definition?
18) How would you use NIST SP 800-145 to evaluate whether an AWS GovCloud deployment truly meets cloud computing requirements?

Vendor Claims & Real-World Scenarios
19) If a vendor says their AWS deployment is a “private cloud,” how would you assess that claim using NIST SP 800-145?
20) How would you explain to leadership why simply running workloads in AWS does not automatically mean you are “doing cloud” under NIST’s definition?

Senior / Architecture-Level Questions
21) How does NIST SP 800-145 help security architects reason about AWS service selection and risk tradeoffs?
22) Why is NIST’s cloud definition still relevant even as AWS introduces new managed and serverless services?

One interview-level closer: “AWS provides cloud services, but NIST SP 800-145 tells us whether we are actually operating as a cloud.”
