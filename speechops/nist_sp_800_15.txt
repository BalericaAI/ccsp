Anticipated Interview Questions
Based on NIST SP 800-145 (Definition of Cloud Computing)
1. Foundational Understanding

How does NIST define cloud computing, and why is that definition still relevant today?
(Interviewers want to see if you understand principles, not buzzwords.)

Why does NIST require all five essential characteristics to be present before calling something “cloud”?
(Tests precision and standards-based thinking.)

2. Essential Characteristics (Deep Reasoning)

Which of the five essential characteristics introduces the greatest security risk, and why?
(There is no single correct answer — reasoning matters.)

How does on-demand self-service change governance and access control compared to traditional IT?
(Signals understanding of IAM and policy challenges.)

Why does rapid elasticity complicate security monitoring and incident response?
(Looks for awareness of scale, ephemerality, and tooling.)

Why does NIST consider measured service a defining characteristic rather than just a billing feature?
(Tests insight into accountability, logging, and auditability.)

3. Multi-Tenancy & Trust

What security assumptions change when moving from single-tenant infrastructure to NIST’s resource pooling model?
(Evaluates threat modeling maturity.)

How would you explain multi-tenancy risk to a non-technical executive using NIST language?
(Tests communication skills.)

4. Service Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)

Why does NIST define cloud service models by abstraction rather than by technology?
(Shows conceptual clarity.)

How does moving from IaaS to SaaS change what a security team is responsible for — even though NIST doesn’t explicitly say so?
(Tests ability to infer shared responsibility.)

5. Deployment Models

Why did NIST include “community cloud” as a distinct deployment model?
(Strong candidates tie this to compliance, shared risk, and governance.)

From a security perspective, when would a hybrid cloud be necessary rather than optional?
(Tests practical judgment.)

6. Virtualization vs Cloud

Why does NIST explicitly state that virtualization alone is not cloud computing?
(Very common interview question.)

Can you give an example of something that uses virtualization but would not meet NIST’s cloud definition?
(Separates memorization from understanding.)

7. Governance & Compliance

Why do you think NIST SP 800-145 avoids prescribing controls or security requirements?
(Shows awareness of how standards are used.)

How does NIST’s definition support frameworks like FedRAMP or CCSP without duplicating them?
(Tests ecosystem-level thinking.)

8. Real-World Application

If a vendor claims they offer “private cloud,” how would you evaluate that claim using NIST SP 800-145?
(This is a very real interview scenario.)

How would you use NIST SP 800-145 to push back on misleading cloud marketing?
(Signals professional confidence.)

9. Meta / Senior-Level Questions

Why do you think NIST chose to publish a short definition document instead of a detailed technical standard?
(Tests long-term thinking.)

If cloud technologies evolve, why does NIST SP 800-145 still matter?
(Great closing question — shows maturity.)

One-sentence interview killer (teach them this)

“NIST SP 800-145 matters because it defines what cloud is before we argue about how to secure it.”
