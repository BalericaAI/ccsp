CCSP Weekly Spine → AWS Security Specialty → GCP Security Engineer


CCSP-D# = CCSP Domain #
AWS-SS = AWS Security Specialty domains
GCP-SE = GCP Security Engineer domains

WEEK 0 – Cloud Definitions & Responsibility (Pre-class)

CCSP

Domain 1 (Foundations)

AWS-SS
✔ Shared Responsibility Model
✔ Security responsibility by service type

GCP-SE
✔ Shared responsibility
✔ Cloud resource hierarchy

Verdict:
Foundational. This week silently carries all three exams.

NIST
NIST SP 800-145 – The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing

Why:
This is the source of truth behind half of CCSP Domain 1.
ISC2 won’t say “NIST says…”, but they test this exact framing.

Essential Characteristics
Service Models
Deployment Models




Weeks 1–2 — Cloud Concepts, Architecture & Design

CCSP
Domain 1: Cloud Concepts, Architecture & Design

AWS-SS
✔ Security architecture design
✔ Multi-account strategies
✔ Trust boundaries

GCP-SE
✔ Organization / Folder / Project model
✔ Design secure cloud architectures

Topics
Cloud characteristics (NIST)
Shared Responsibility Model (THIS WILL BE TESTED)
Deployment models (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS)
Multi-tenancy risks
Reference architectures

Instructor emphasis
How ISC2 frames responsibility, not technology
Where candidates confuse AWS reality vs exam theory

Homework
Read Domain 1
30–40 practice questions

NIST
SP 800-145 (again, lightly)
SP 800-146 – Cloud Computing Synopsis and Recommendations

Focus on:
Cloud risks vs traditional IT
Roles and responsibilities
Security implications of service models

Why CCSP cares:
This is where shared responsibility logic is born.



Weeks 3–6 — Cloud Data Security
(Domain 2 – biggest domain, highest ROI)

Topics

Data lifecycle (create → destroy)
Data classification
Encryption (at rest / in transit / in use)
Key management (HSM, BYOK, HYOK)
Tokenization vs masking
Backup & retention

Instructor emphasis

Ownership vs custody
Who controls keys in each service model
Data residency vs sovereignty (exam loves this)

Homework
Read Domain 2
Weekly practice questions (40–50)

NIST
SP 800-60 Vol. 1 – Guide for Mapping Types of Information
SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (skim) – Data-related controls

Focus on:
Data categorization
Impact levels (low / moderate / high)
Why classification drives controls

Why CCSP cares:
Data ownership vs custody is the exam’s favorite trap.

SP 800-57 Part 1 – Key Management
SP 800-175B – Crypto Mechanisms

Focus on:
Key ownership
Key lifecycle
Separation of duties

Why CCSP cares:
CCSP doesn’t ask how to encrypt — it asks who controls the keys.

Weeks 7–9 — Cloud Platform & Infrastructure Security
(Domain 3)

Topics
Hypervisor risks
VM isolation
Container basics (not Kubernetes deep dive)
Network segmentation
Identity & access at platform level
Physical vs logical security

Instructor emphasis
Cloud changes who does what, not what must be done
Where exam assumes “provider responsibility”

Homework
Read Domain 3
30–40 questions

NIST

SP 800-125 – Security for Virtualization
SP 800-190 – Application Container Security Guide

Focus on:
Isolation assumptions
Hypervisor risks
Shared infrastructure concerns

Why CCSP cares:
This explains why provider responsibility ≠ customer responsibility.

SP 800-207 – Zero Trust Architecture

Focus on:
Identity-centric security
Least privilege
Trust boundaries

Why CCSP cares:
This maps directly to modern cloud IAM thinking without vendor bias.

Weeks 10–12 — Cloud Application Security
(Domain 4)

Topics
Secure SDLC in the cloud
DevOps vs DevSecOps
APIs (huge exam topic)
IAM integration
OWASP relevance
CI/CD risks

Instructor emphasis
CCSP ≠ developer exam
Focus on governance and control, not coding

Homework
Read Domain 4
Practice questions + review wrong answers

NST
SP 800-218 – Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)
SP 800-204 – Microservices Security

Focus on:
Secure SDLC responsibilities
DevSecOps concepts
API risk

Why CCSP cares:
CCSP tests governance, not coding.

SP 800-95 – Guide to Secure Web Services

Focus on:
Authentication
Authorization
Data exposure risks

Weeks 13–15 — Cloud Security Operations
(Domain 5)

Topics
Logging & monitoring
Incident response in cloud
Forensics challenges
Business continuity / DR
Vendor lock-in risks
SLA management

Instructor emphasis
Cloud IR ≠ on-prem IR
Evidence handling & chain of custody (exam loves this)

Homework
Read Domain 5
30–40 questions

NIST

SP 800-61 Rev. 2 – Computer Security Incident Handling Guide

Focus on:
IR phases
Cloud complications
Coordination challenges

Why CCSP cares:
Cloud IR ≠ on-prem IR — and they test that distinction.

SP 800-92 – Guide to Computer Security Log Management
SP 800-86 – Integrating Forensics

Focus on:
Evidence handling
Log ownership
Forensic limitations in cloud


Weeks 16–17 — Legal, Risk & Compliance
(Domain 6 – tricky, wordy, test-heavy)

Topics
Contracts & SLAs
Jurisdiction issues
Privacy laws (GDPR-style thinking)
eDiscovery
Risk assessment
Audit responsibilities

Instructor emphasis
This is ISSAP territory
Always ask: who is accountable?

Homework
Read Domain 6
40–50 questions

NIST

SP 800-30 Rev. 1 – Risk Assessment
SP 800-37 Rev. 2 – Risk Management Framework (RMF)

Focus on:
Risk ownership
Authorization
Accountability

Why CCSP cares:
This is where ISSAP logic dominates.

Revisit:
SP 800-145
SP 800-53 (control families overview)
SP 800-61

Goal:
Reinforce responsibility mapping, not details.

Weeks 18–19 — Full Review & Weakness Attack
(This is where you earn the pass)

Class structure
Week 18: Domains 1–3 review
Week 19: Domains 4–6 review

Activities
Identify weak domains
Explain why wrong answers are wrong
Drill shared responsibility questions
